ABSTRACT

Object recognition for 2D or 3D images becomes more and more popular and technologies that are being developed are more efficiend and simpler, while quality and precision remain high. The method used in this project is ESF(Ensemble of shape functions). It is one of many methodes included in the PCL library. ESF is shape function that is simple and has various applications. This method is primarily designed for object recognition, but there are other applications like registration, calculating distances or calculating normals in geometric environment. In this project, a program for object classification using ESF method is described and it is tested on the 3DNet data set.
